K-Means notes
Initialization: pick the initial centroids randomly from the data
Mitigating the potential for local optima: re-run K-means algorithm many times (maybe 50 times) with different initial centroids and use the best set of centroids when done
Determing performance: minimize distortion function ||x^(i) - mu_i||^2

PCA Notes:
DO NOT use to change the bias / variance of your model (since you are throwing away information that is not lost when you simply do regularization)
Really handy for speeding up learning algorithms or for plotting the axes of your data with the highest variance.
