K-Means notes
Initialization: pick the initial centroids randomly from the data
Mitigating the potential for local optima: re-run K-means algorithm many times (maybe 50 times) with different initial centroids and use the best set of centroids when done
Determing performance: minimize distortion function ||x^(i) - mu_i||^2
